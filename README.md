# Twitter with Twarc

[![Create a Slack Account with us](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create_Slack_Account-The_Carpentries-071159.svg)](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)

An initial run of this lesson was conducted at UCSB in May 2022.

This is a 5 hour Carpentries lesson on using the twarc2 Python application to harvest Tweets 
using the Twitter v2 API in a Jupyter environment. The lesson reinforces core BASH directory 
structure management, input- and output- arguments, Python dataframe, sorting, and counting
functions.

Proper research data management topics, including respectful community archiving, attention
to consent, respect for personhood and privacy, and adherence to Twitter's Terms of Service
and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation are included throughout.

## What comes next?

- We are currently working on standardizing and shortening filenames throughout the entire lesson.
- We would love feedback on this work!
- Check the [issues](issues)!

There's still a little Carpentry advice:
